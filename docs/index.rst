Managing a lot of passwords might be hard in today's digital environment. Dashlane is one of the most trustworthy password managers, and this is where it comes in. It lets people store, organize, and autofill passwords on all of their devices from one safe place. The first thing you need to do to use its strong features is log in to your Dashlane account.

This article shows you how to log in to Dashlane step by step, no matter if you're using a PC, a mobile app, or a browser extension. We'll also talk about typical login problems and how to fix them so you can get into your account without any trouble.

Step 1: Decide how you want to get to Dashlane
You can get to Dashlane by:

Dashlane Web App (in a web browser)

Mobile app (for Android or iOS)

Add-on for browsers like Chrome, Firefox, Edge, and Safari

You can use any of these methods to sign in with the same account. The login steps are mostly the same, even though the UI may look a little different.

Step 2: If you're using the online app, go to the Dashlane Login Page.

To get to the Dashlane login page, open your browser and type in: https://www.dashlane.com/login

If you're on the app for your phone:

Open the Dashlane app from your app drawer or home screen.

If you have the addon for your browser:

In the toolbar of your browser, click on the Dashlane symbol.

A small window for logging in will pop up.

Step 3: Type in the email address you used to sign up on the login page:

Enter the email address that is linked to your Dashlane account.

Press "Continue" or "Next."

If you've logged in before, the mobile app might be able to find your registered email. If not, type it in by hand.

Step 4: Type in your master password.
When you enter your email, you'll be asked to enter your Master Password. This is the key password that lets you get into all of your saved information and credentials.

⚠️ Dashlane does not keep your Master Password safe. If you forget it, you will have to reset your account if you don't have recovery options turned on.

Be careful when you type your Master Password.

If you've turned it on, you can also utilize biometric login (Face ID or fingerprint) on your phone.

To continue, click "Log In."

Step 5: Two-Factor Authentication (if it's turned on)
If your account has Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) turned on:

You will get a 6-digit number using the authentication method you specified, such as Google Authenticator or SMS.

Type the code into the box and click "Verify."

This extra layer of security keeps anyone who shouldn't be able to get into your vault from doing so.

Step 6: Get inside your vault
After you log in, you'll go to the Dashlane Vault. You can do the following on your dashboard:

See stored passwords

Make passwords that are hard to guess

Keep payment methods and secure notes safe

Share credentials in a safe way

Sync between devices

The vault may show up as a dropdown panel or pop-up window in the browser if you have a browser extension.

Step 7: Optional: Stay Logged In
For your convenience, Dashlane lets you stay logged in:

Before you log in, check the box that says "Remember me" in the login window.

Dashlane can stay unlocked on mobile devices utilizing biometrics to make it easier to get to.

⚠️ Don't turn this option on on shared or public computers to keep your private information safe.

Problems with logging in and how to fix them
Most of the time, logging in is quick and easy, but there are occasions when it might be hard. This is how to fix them:

1. Did you forget your master password?
Go to the login page and click the "Forgot Password?" option.

Do what it says to do to become better. You can get back in if you turned on account recovery or biometric login.

Otherwise, you may have to reset your whole account, which will wipe all the data in your vault for protection.

2. Wrong Email or Password: Make sure there are no errors in your email or password.

Make sure that Caps Lock isn't on.

Use the new email address if you've changed it recently.

3. Not Getting the 2FA Code
Please wait a moment or ask for the code again.

Look in your SMS inbox or authenticator app.

Check to see if your phone can connect to the internet.

4. Problems with the browser
Try deleting your cookies and cache.

Make sure that the Dashlane extension is up to date and installed.

If you need to, turn off any extensions that are causing problems.

How to Make Your Login Safe
Make sure your Master Password is strong and one-of-a-kind. Don't use the same password for more than one account.

For better security, turn on two-factor authentication.

Don't log in on public networks or shared devices.

To get the most recent security fixes, be sure to update the app and browser extension on a regular basis.
